## About

This blog exists to provide structure to my thinking and to document my progress as I learn new technologies and skills. I hope to someday look back on my first posts with a bit of nostalgia and embarassment.

If you're reading this, I hope it's because you've found something helpful!

## Author

Hello! I'm Damon. That's my face in the picture at the top of the page. It was a bright day, I was facing the sun, and I think it's a great shot. Fortunately, this is not a photography blog.

If I had to pick a some keywords to describe myself, they would be:

- programmer
- game design enthusiast
- 3d printing hobbyist

Outside of work, I play lots of games, drink lots of coffee, and enjoy the grandeur of the Pacific Northwest alongside my family.

Inside of work, I build backend data services on AWS using TypeScript and Node (among other things). If you think I'd be a good fit on your team, check out my [resume](/damon-resume-jan-2021.pdf) and reach out via one of the methods below!
